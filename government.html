	                            <p>In this project  I was designing a typographic work that explores the subject of “Taboo”. During my reascherch I’ve decided to concentrate on hystorical taboo in Poland. <br>
                    			In 966 Poland was babtise but there is lots of historical facts before that date which were never discussed by anyone for many years- and that was the main reason for taking up this subject. <br>
                    			I’ve decided to design three posters called: <b>Teritory, Govermant, Believs.</b> <br>
                    			
                    			All three posters are containg original letters from glagolica ( the oldest alphabet).</p>

	                            <p><b> <a href="territory.html">Territory</a></b><br>In first one I included important information about area of Poland and tribes leaving in those borders. I’ve also wanted to picture  years of fight for independent life. <br><b> <a href="government.html">Government</a></b><br>Second poster is shawing big power and influence of church and govermant trying to destroy years of tradition and believs. <br> 
	                            <b><a href="beliefs.html">Beliefs</a></b><br>Last poster is the image of people being strongly connected to the nature with it’s magic power. <br>
